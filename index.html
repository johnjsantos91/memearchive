<h1>Brief history of Political Caricatures</h1>
<h2>  When it started?</h2>
<p>Political caricatures can be traced in history from 1732 with William Hogarth's "A Harlot's Progress".<br>
   Political caricatures make social criticism through acid humor on political issues like abuse of power, corruption, and ineffective management of political leaders.

<p>The French Realist painter, sculptor, and caricaturist Honor√© Daumier gained great popularity during the Napoleonic Era, being imprisoned in 1832 for his "Gargantua"<br>
    Daumier exposes in an artistic manner and full of satirical humor the imbalance of power and resource management of a government.

        <h1>Political Memes</h1>
<p>  Memes are part of everyday media consumption. Through humor, just like political caricatures, they evoke reality and different viewpoints from a variety of demographic groups.<br>
    Images and texts change depending on the message they want to convey.<br>
    Political memes have become a strong medium of propaganda, having the advantage of being anonymous.<br>
    This aspect gives total freedom of speech, triggering a POLITICAL MEME WAR.</p>
